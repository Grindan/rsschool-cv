## Code example

_Decided to attach the solution for one of codewars katas: [**Let's Recycle!**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b6db1acb118141f6b000060)
The list of objects with `type`, `material` and `?secondMaterial` properties was given. The task was to sort objects across the 4 recycling bins._

```js
function recycle(array) {
    const materials = ['paper', 'glass', 'organic', 'plastic'];
    const obj = array.reduce((acc, el) => {
        acc[el.material] = acc[el.material] || [];
        acc[el.material].push(el.type);

        if (el.secondMaterial) {
            acc[el.secondMaterial] = acc[el.secondMaterial] || [];
            acc[el.secondMaterial].push(el.type);
        }

        return acc;
    }, {});

    return materials.map((el) => obj[el] || []);
}
```
